# 1198. Find Smallest Common Element in All Rows  

Given a matrix mat where every row is sorted in increasing order, return the smallest common element in all rows.  

If there is no common element, return -1.  
 

**Example 1:**  

    Input: mat = [[1,2,3,4,5],[2,4,5,8,10],[3,5,7,9,11],[1,3,5,7,9]]
    Output: 5
 

**Constraints:**  

* 1 <= mat.length, mat[i].length <= 500
* 1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4
* mat[i] is sorted in increasing order.
