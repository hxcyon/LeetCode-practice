# 461. Hamming Distance  

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.  

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.  

**Note:**  
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

**Example:**  

    Input: x = 1, y = 4
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)
