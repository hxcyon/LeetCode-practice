# 28. Implement strStr()  

Implement strStr().  

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.  

**Example 1:**

    Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
    Output: 2

**Example 2:**

    Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
    Output: -1

**Clarification:**

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.  

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
